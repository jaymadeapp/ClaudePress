# Changelog

All notable changes to ClaudePress are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-27

Security & correctness hardening (adversarial review pass).

### Fixed

- **Two-lane guard bypasses** — `guard-two-lane.sh` now blocks DB exfiltration over
  `ssh`/`scp`/`rsync`/`sftp`/`nc` and `mysqldump | mysql -h`, blocks any `wp db import`,
  and runs a real `git status` check so bulk `git add -A` can't sneak `.env`/`.sql`
  dumps past the guard. `settings.json` deny-list gained the same transports.
- **`git checkout` false-positive** — the Woo guard no longer blocks `git checkout`
  (and other `checkout` paths); checkout/cart/payment patterns are anchored to real
  WooCommerce file paths, and order-data blocks are gated on `flags.WOO`.
- **Hooks wiring** — PreToolUse matchers now include `Write|Edit|MultiEdit`, so the
  write-side guards (e.g. blocking a `.env` write) actually run.
- **`.mcp.json` now generated** — `scaffold.sh` writes the project `.mcp.json` from the
  build-type template and rewrites the WordPress MCP runner to native `wp` for no-Docker.
- **DDEV `php_version`** now honors the chosen PHP version (was hardcoded 8.3).
- **bash 3.2 (macOS)** — fixed empty-array expansion abort in `scaffold.sh`.
- **No-Docker** — dropped the misleading "wp-env" mention, added a `wp-cli.yml`
  (`path: web/wp`) and a native serving note. Broadened the PHP-version regex to
  accept 8.10+/9.x. Reconciled docs that claimed `composer install` runs in scaffold.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-27

Initial release.

### Added

- **Plugin manifest & marketplace** — `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and
  `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` so the kit installs via
  `/plugin marketplace add` + `/plugin install`.
- **Interactive install skill** — `skills/wp-setup/` (`/claudepress:wp-setup`).
  Asks for local env (Docker/no-Docker), build type (website/WooCommerce e-shop),
  project slug and subtype, then renders a tailored project from bundled templates:
  `composer.json`, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, `.mcp.json`, DDEV config,
  `theme.json`, `phpcs.xml`, `phpstan.neon`, restricted client roles, a tests
  skeleton and a tailored `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Role-based agents** — `agents/wp-orchestrator`, `wp-analyst`, `wp-architect`,
  `wp-engineer`, `wp-security-reviewer`, `wp-tester`, all pinned to Opus 4.8
  (`claude-opus-4-8`).
- **Security layer** — fail-closed hooks (`hooks/hooks.json`) wiring
  `guard-two-lane.sh` and `guard-woo-data.sh` (PreToolUse), `lint-php.sh`
  (PostToolUse) and `phpstan.sh` (Stop gate). The two-lane invariant and
  WooCommerce data-safety gate are enforced by these hook scripts, not by
  permission globs.
- **MCP least-privilege, auto-provisioned** — plugin-root `.mcp.json` ships only
  the Playwright MCP server. Per-project templates wire the WordPress MCP via the
  canonical `WordPress/mcp-adapter` plugin over **STDIO via WP-CLI** — no
  application password, no secret in the file. `scripts/setup-mcp.sh` auto-installs
  the adapter and creates a content-only least-privilege user `claudepress-mcp`
  (role `claudepress_mcp`; e-shop role excludes order/payment caps), so local
  setup is zero-touch. The HTTP-proxy + Application Password path
  (`@automattic/mcp-wordpress-remote`, `WP_MCP_APP_PASSWORD`) remains documented as
  a remote/production-only fallback.
- **Documentation** — `README.md`, `LICENSE` (MIT), `NOTICE` and this changelog.
